        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Book My Bite</strong> — your simple, smart, and
          reliable gateway to discovering amazing restaurants around you.
          Whether you're craving a comforting Indian thali, a cheesy Italian
          pizza, spicy Mexican flavors, or delicate Japanese sushi, our platform
          helps you find the perfect place without stress or confusion. We
          created Book My Bite with one mission: to make food discovery easy,
          intuitive, and enjoyable for everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea for Book My Bite began with a simple real-life problem. Our
          founder and his friends were trying to decide where to eat. One wanted
          Italian, another wanted Japanese, someone suggested street food, and
          someone needed something affordable. They checked apps, websites,
          menus, maps — but nothing gave clear results quickly. Everything felt
          scattered. That day, the thought came: why not build a platform where
          users can search by anything — title, cuisine, country, or location —
          and instantly get meaningful, accurate results? From that moment, Book
          My Bite was born.
        </p>

        <p>
          Book My Bite is designed to be a clean and powerful restaurant
          discovery engine. Type a search term, click a category, or filter by
          cuisine — and you’ll instantly see places that match exactly what
          you’re looking for. Each restaurant is displayed with a clear image,
          price, category, owner, and location so you get all important details
          at a glance. Behind the scenes, our system uses modern technologies
          like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Cloud services to give you fast
          and reliable results every time.
        </p>

        <p>
          We built Book My Bite for everyone — for students who want affordable
          meals, for families wanting a comfortable place to dine, for
          travellers exploring a new city, and for food lovers searching for
          something new. If you're someone who hates scrolling endlessly or
          switching between apps, this platform is made for you. A few clicks,
          one simple search bar, and you're ready to explore.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Book My Bite, our values define everything we do. We believe in
          <strong>authenticity</strong>, which means showing real places with
          real images and honest details. We believe in
          <strong>simplicity</strong> — a platform should never confuse you; it
          should guide you. We promote <strong>diversity</strong> by welcoming
          every cuisine and every type of dining experience. And most
          importantly, we believe in <strong>community</strong>. Each user, each
          restaurant owner, each review — they all help shape the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we continue to grow, our vision is to add advanced features like
          maps, galleries, user dashboards, richer reviews, and global
          restaurant listings. We want Book My Bite to be more than just a
          directory. We want it to be your partner whenever you step out to eat
          — a trusted companion that helps you find good food faster and easier.
        </p>

        <p>
